# etsy-python
Python access to the Etsy V2 API

By Dan McKinley - dan@etsy.com - [http://mcfunley.com](http://mcfunley.com)
Updated by Chris Lapa for Python 3.6+

## Installation

This version of etsy-python has not been pushed to pypi.org. Instead it can be installed from Github.
pip install git+https://github.com/store-manager/etsy-python.git@0.4.1

## Example with OAuth

Register an app [here](https://www.etsy.com/developers/register).

<pre>
from etsy import EtsyOAuthClient, EtsyAPI, EtsyEnvProduction

app_scope = ["transactions_r", "listings_r"] # Valid values can be viewed [here](https://www.etsy.com/developers/documentation/getting_started/oauth#section_permission_scopes)
user_token_path = 'access_token.json'
oauth_consumer_key = '123456789' # Keystring from your Apps API here](https://www.etsy.com/developers/your-apps)
oauth_consumer_secret = 'abcdef' # Shared secret from your Apps API [here](https://www.etsy.com/developers/your-apps)
env = EtsyEnvProduction
oauth = EtsyOAuthClient.load(user_token_path,
                             oauth_consumer_key,
                             oauth_consumer_secret,
                             etsy_env=env)

if not oauth.authorized:
    signin_url = oauth.get_signin_url(app_scope)
    print('Visit the following url in your browser, authorize the app and paste the signin code:')
    print(signin_url)
    code = input()
    oauth.get_access_token(code)
    oauth.save(user_token_path)

api = EtsyAPI(oauth_client=oauth, etsy_env=env)
print(api.inventory())
</pre>


## Method Table Caching

This module is implemented by metaprogramming against the method table published
by the Etsy API. In other words, API methods are not explicitly declared by the
code in this module. Instead, the list of allowable methods is downloaded and 
the patched into the API objects at runtime.

This has advantages and disadvantages. It allows the module to automatically 
receive new features, but on the other hand, this process is not as fast as 
explicitly declared methods. 

In order to speed things up, the method table json is cached locally by default.
If a $HOME/etsy directory exists, the cache file is created there. Otherwise, it 
is placed in the machine's temp directory. By default, this cache lasts 24 hours.

The cache file can be specified when creating an API object:

<pre>
from etsy import EtsyAPI

api = EtsyAPI(method_cache='myfile.json')
</pre>

Method table caching can also be disabled by passing None as the cache parameter:

<pre>
from etsy import Etsy

# do not cache methods
api = EtsyAPI(method_cache=None)
</pre>
